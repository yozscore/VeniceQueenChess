Named after the Red Hot Chili Peppers song! This is a very hastily made Chess AI application. 

The AI is very brute-forced, and only runs on minimax with alpha-beta pruning and move sorting optimizations. There is no clever evaluation function beyond pawn counting (with square biases). If you'd like to know more, there are more than enough resources online - just look up the buzzwords mentioned here!

Overall, I wouldn't expect the bot to play too well, but it can play well enough to humiliate me half the time! (I am terrible at the game, so it doesn't mean much

See if you can beat the bot [here](https://yozscore.github.io/VeniceQueenChess/)!
