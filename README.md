# Venice Queen

Named after the Red Hot Chili Peppers song! This is a very hastily made Chess AI application. 

The AI is very brute-forced, and only runs on minimax with alpha-beta pruning and move sorting optimizations. There is no clever evaluation function beyond pawn counting (with square biases).

Overall, I wouldn't expect the bot to play too well, but it can play well enough to humiliate me half the time! I'm horrible at the game so take that however you may :)

I've written down a couple of explanations for the algorithms in `script.js`. Check it out if you want.

The application also provides a real-time PGN display, so you can export a game if you want to by copying it.

See if you can beat the bot [here](https://yozscore.github.io/VeniceQueenChess/)!
